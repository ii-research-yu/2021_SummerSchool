# Summer School Course: Introduction to Learning-to-Rank


## 1. Questionnaire
In order to make the course interesting and easy-to-follow, it would be highly appreciated if you could provide some details on the following questions, thanks for your collaboration and time!

- Before the course

- After the course

  https://wj.qq.com/s2/8749791/46a5/

## 2. Expected preliminary preparations

If you're not familiar with python, it will be quite helpful to learn some basics on **python** and **numpy** before the course based on the resources on the web, especially getting the environment for testing python programs prepared, since we plan to share some example python programs as a reference.

## 3. Required exercises after each lecture (dynamically updated)

- Exercises after Lecture-1
